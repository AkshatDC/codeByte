This project aims to analyze the impact of plastic pollution on marine life using statistical methods. 
The goal is to understand the distribution of measurements related to plastic pollution, evaluate if the measurements significantly differ from a hypothetical mean,
and explore any potential relationships between these measurements and geographical coordinates. The project aims to contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 14 
(SDG 14): Life Below Water by providing insights and actionable conclusions from the data.

Data Description

The project utilizes four datasets:

  1.	Raw Data: Contains raw observations related to plastic pollution, including measurements and geographical information.
  2.	Cleaned Data 1: Processed data with cleaned and structured information, including measurements, density ranges, and location details.
  3.	Cleaned Data 2: A dataset focused on species data with attributes like taxonomy, state province, and event dates.
  4.	Cleaned Data 3: Contains biodiversity data with species counts, latitudes, and longitudes.

Methodology

The following statistical methods were applied to the cleaned data:
1.	One-Sample T-Test:
--> Hypothetical mean: 1
--> Purpose: To determine if the sample mean of the measurements differs significantly from the hypothetical mean.

2.	Descriptive Statistics:
--> Calculated the mean, median, and standard deviation of the measurement values to summarize their distribution.

3.	Correlation Analysis:
--> Examined the correlation between measurement values and geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) to understand spatial relationships.

Results

One-Sample T-Test:
•	T-Statistic: 2.044
•	P-Value: 0.042
•	Interpretation: The p-value indicates a statistically significant difference between the sample mean and the hypothetical mean.

Findings and Visualizations

Infographic Summary:
--> Plastic pollution is a significant threat to marine life, causing death and harm to various species.
--> Microplastics are particularly dangerous as they are ingested by marine organisms, entering the food chain.
--> The infographic highlights statistics such as the percentage of marine species affected, the volume of plastic waste, and the most impacted regions.

Data Visualization:
•	Graph Analysis:
--> The graph from the second image displays the relationship between plastic pollution levels and marine species affected.
--> It shows a positive correlation between high plastic concentration areas and the number of affected marine species.
--> Specific regions with the highest impact are identified, indicating hotspots for targeted conservation efforts.

Conclusion

1.	Impact on Species: The data clearly indicates that plastic pollution has a detrimental impact on marine biodiversity. 
                       Species across various phyla and classes are affected, with some regions showing higher vulnerability.
2.	Pollution Hotspots: Certain areas are identified as pollution hotspots where the concentration of plastic waste is significantly higher.
                       These regions should be prioritized for clean-up and conservation efforts.
3.	Policy Implications: The findings suggest the need for stricter regulations on plastic waste management and more robust conservation strategies to protect marine life.

Recommendations:

•	Awareness and Education: Increase public awareness about the impact of plastic pollution and promote sustainable practices.
•	Policy and Regulation: Advocate for stronger policies to reduce plastic production and improve waste management systems.
•	Research and Monitoring: Continue research to monitor the long-term effects of plastic pollution and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.
