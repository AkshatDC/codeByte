It was originally reported that approximately 500 lbs of the anhydrous ammonia leaked out August 30, however, on September 1 it was discovered that 6000 lbs (this was the full amount on board) of anhydrous ammonia was discharged from the tanks. Approximately 50 lbs of this entered the space it was released in, while the rest drained into the bilge and slowly off gassed. Readings of ammonia in the air were high within the vessel, but were at safe levels outside of the vessel. On scene contractors are following safety precautions.

Recent increases in the sightings of small oil blobs in the area of Lena Pt. resulted in Sector Juneau's decision to seriously evaluate the wreck for possible removal of the remaining fuel, which is very roughly estimated at 155,000 gallons of bunker C.  On Feb. 16, 2010, Global Offshore Divers of Anchorage mobilized a three-man remote operated vehicle crew to Juneau in response to a request by the USCG, Sector Juneau's Incident management, to survey the wreck of this vessel.   The survey lasted a total of three days from Feb. 17-19 with two ROV's, and the first entry in this Hotline is the Global Diving report from those surveys.    After mobilization of equipment from Seattle, Global Diving tentatively hopes to start pumping oil on or about March 5.  NOAA has been asked to provide weather and trajectory support for this incident. All operations progressed methodically, and hence most of the fuel was successfully removed."

Fuel was being transferred from a tanker at the adjacent loading dock, when overflow of the tank occurred discharging the diesel into an adjacent oil/water separator.  This unit was also overwhelmed and  the fuel entered Helmet Creek which flows into the small boat harbor portion of Sweeper Cove.  Initially, two areas of hard boom with sorbent boom were placed along the creek and a vac truck was deployed at the oil/water separator.  As of the morning of Jan. 12, it is believed that the vast majority of the diesel was confined to or collected in the stream, and only an estimated 1000 gallons had entered the small boat harbor.   Apparently conditions are fairly calm in Sweeper Cove.   The Coast Guard is planning on chartering a flight out to Adak to ascertain the situation.

It is expected that an interagency conference call will be held this week to determine whether an investigation to evaluate response options,  is warranted.  At the national level,  ERD is developing an interagency agreement with the USCG under which the agencies will work together to address threats from vessels sunken off US shores that contain significant volumes of oil.

The barge has 72,000 gallons of gasoline and 72,000 gallons of Jet fuel.  The barge is a 1968 single skin barge.   The grounded barge had gone through two tidal cycles, during which the tug could not pull it off the bottom, prior to notifying CG Sector Anchorage on Sept. 17.

Upon returning to 160-1, barge OB-5 itself grounded just west of the location of the 160-1.

These eruptions caused lahars, extensive fllooding, and mud flows around the Drift River Tank Farm, where oil from the Cook Inlet fields is temporarily stored prior to shipping out aboard tankers.    Currently, two of the four active tanks have 74,000 bbls of oil apiece. At 7:30 PM on March 23rd, ADEC and USCG conducted an over-flight to determine any potential threat to the tank farm and related facilities at the Drift River Terminal.  They observed extensive flooding to the area with mud flows to a depth of six feet in the area of the runway and ballast tank, but no significant penetration of the 18 to 20 foot high teritiary containment berm around the tank farm.  No oil or hazardous substance releases have been reported at this time.  Cook Inlet Pipeline Company, operator of the tank farm, is planning on-the-ground evaluation today of the teritiary berms, pumps, and other equipment and facilities necessary for the operation of the tank farm.   The Alaska Volcano Observatory is predicting additional explosive activity of the volcano in the near future, which combined with the extensive amount of snow and ice on the flanks of Redoubt could cause additional significant flooding and mud flows towards the Drift River Tank Farm.    The Coast Guard has asked the NOAA SSC to keep fully abreast of the situation and to participate in conference calls among the CG, the state, the tank farm operator and others.         The last  major explosive eruption of Redoubt volcano occurred on April 4.  It was the largest eruption, during this sequence,  and produced the largest lahar to date, completely encircling the Drift River Tank Farm (DRTF).    None of the mud or water, however, penetrated the large dikes around the facility.   As an additional safety precaution, Chevron and Cook Inlet Pipeline decided to completely shut in the  DRTF and proceeded to draw down the oil in the two active storage tanks to minimal levels.    To achieve greater tank stability, 30,000 Bbls of fresh water was added to each of the two active tanks.        With no eruptions since April 4 and dome building in the volcano's throat dramatically decreasing, the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) decided to downgrade the threat level of the volcano from orange to yellow on June 29, 2009.   "

At 6:30 a.m. a containment boom was set around the vessel by the Craig Harbormaster response boat (Josie J) to mitigate further discharge of oil.  A CG  helo conducted an overflight of the stricken vessel at approximately 8:50 a.m.and reported a 2.5 nautical mile long sheen coming off the vessel.   The helo crew also reported the containment boom transported to the scene had been deployed.   Meanwhile, the CG contracted with SEAPRO for site assessment and the SEAPRO oil spill response vessel M/V Rudyard Bay departed Ketchikan at 7:30 a.m.  but did not arrive on-scene until night fall of that day.   By early afternoon on Feb. 17, the owner of the vessel reported all the vents on the vessel's oil tanks were successfully plugged during the afternoon low tide.  A second CG overflight conducted during the morning of Feb. 18 reported only sheen on the water.   Being a Sunday followed by a holiday, the CG was unable to roust any potential salvors and/or divers who could sound the fuel tanks, although the CG is currently working to develop salvage and lightering plans.   The capacity of the vessel is 4000 gallons of diesel in four tanks, 150 gallons of lube oil and 150 gallons of hydraulic oil; however, at this time the amount of fuel remaining in the tanks is unknown.    No sensitive resources were identified by the CG within 45 miles of the grounding site.  Salvor and marine surveyor finally hired to deal with the situation.   In the interim the M/V Rudyard Bay had pumped out over 4000 gals of diesel, and the marine surveyor reported no visible signs of oil in the engine room and some residual bilge slop oil in the forward compartment.

The source, the amount and the product were (and remain) unconfirmed.  However, it is suspected that the release happened sometime on the night of Sunday January 08 and was a diesel or #2 heating oil product (chemical analysis through the  USCG Marine Safety Lab is pending) and the amount is somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 gallons. Helped by slow currents and consistent west to southwest winds, a large portion of the released product pooled at the northern end of the Island End River (IER) and recovery operations have been focused there.  Some oil sheen was reported in the Mystic River (upper end of Boston Harbor) and in the Chelsea River, about a half a mile east of the IER, but none of it was deemed recoverable.  Protective booming of the salt marshes at the end of the Chelsea River (aka: ""Chelsea Creek"") was deployed as an extra safety measure. The Island End River is more of an inlet than a true river.  Historically (a century ago) it flowed through Chelsea and Everett to the sea.  Today it terminate approximately a quarter mile from the Mystic River (generally considered part of Boston Harbor), is about 200 yards wide and heavily industrialized on one side.  The other side has a small park and condominium project known as Admiral Hill.  Environmentally the area is of note due to historic (and heavy) contamination from coal tar.  The bottom sediments as well as much of the southeastern shoreline are contaminated by chronic (now secured) and acute releases of the materials.  The exposed coal tar on the shoreline dates back to the 1940s.  The material is a byproduct of a large coal gasification facility that operated from the turn of the 19th century to sometime in the early 1960s.   Response Activities: The USCG has been supervising the oil spill cleanup contractor as it uses vacuum trucks and sorbents to recover trapped materials.  Over 3,000 gallons (oil) have been recovered thus far.  NOAA Activities: The NOAA SSC has been working with the FOSC and SOSC on cleanup options and spill characterization, including work with the NOAA HAZMAT modeling staff on oil fate calculations, and reverse trajectories."

The storage tank's capacity was 500,000 gallons.  An unknown amount of product entered the Arthur Kill waterway that separates New Jersey and Staten Island, New York.  An unknown amount was contained within the tank's dike system and the facility's storm water containment system.  In addition, as a result of the tank failure a second tank sustained damage and also leaked an unknown amount of sodium hydroxide but this leak has been contained.  Three individuals were suffered burns.  Two were treated and released, third is being held in the hospital for further observations.  The RP in cooperation with the USCG are in the process of determining how much product entered the Arthur Kill.  Cause of the incident is under investigation.  Sodium hydroxide solution is a liquid caustic soda.  It is a colorless solution that contains components that are corrosive, and can be damaging to human health and the environment.  At 50% solution, the product has a specific gravity of 1.53 and a density of 12.76.  Sodium hydroxide solution can substantially raise the pH of an aquatic environment and can be extremely toxic to fish and aquatic plants.   "

Fearful of capsizing, the captain put out a MAYDAY andall five crewmen were lifted from the vessel by a Coast Guardhelicopter.

With winds shiftingto the north the Coast Guard became very concerned that it might groundon Amak Island, the site of a sea lion haulout, classified as anendangered species.   At this point the Coast Guard asked NOAA to getinvolved and provide a ""most likely"" trajectory for the vessel.   NOAA'strajectory had the F/V Raven just missing the east side of the islandand grounding on the barrier islands outside of Izembek Lagoon, aNational Wildlife Refuge being very sensitive with its large number oftransient waterfowl waiting to migrate southward.   The CGC Morgenthauwas on scene shadowing the Raven but was unable to attach a towline dueto the heavy seas.   Instead, it attached a drogue, which slowed themovement of the vessel.  Meanwhile the owner hired Dan Magone fromUnalaska to attempt to come to the scene and offer assistance.   Danarrived when the Raven was only 1 nautical mile off the NE coast of AmakIsland, and in a dramatic rescue was able to get a line on the vesselonly 0.3 nm from the island and keep it from grounding.

The location of the sunken vessel was N60-33.0, W145-46.3, and it went down with an estimated 500 gallons of diesel in an area of very strong tidal currents.  A long oil slick was noted on the surface, and it was believed that this was just the fuel emanating from the vents and that the two fuel tanks were intact.   Trying to beat some forecast heavy winds for the night of August 19, the owner immediately hired divers to plug the vents.  In so doing the divers noted that the starboard tank was empty of an estimated 200 gallons of diesel.   The next day, when the strong winds never materialized, divers again descended to the vessel to attempt to pump out the port fuel tank, but found it empty also.   Apparently all the fuel  had escaped the first day and been rapidly dispersed by the strong tidal currents, and there was probably less than 500 gallons of diesel on the vessel when in sank.  NOAA provided support to the CG with weather, tidal and resources at risk information.

Upon arriving at the command center at noon the SSC was briefed about the barge explosion and subsequent gasoline spill. The barge (what was left of it) and manifold system on the dock were still on fire. The location of the ExxonMobile facility was: 40deg 31.5 N / 74deg 14.5 W. Trajectory and weather support were requested ASAP as well as resources at risk. Oil weathering calculations determined that the gasoline would evaporate very quickly (about 90% in the first several hours). The two major biological concerns from the environmental point of view were rafting waterfowl and potential fish kill. The SSC recommended that the fire be left burning as long as possible as long as it posed no further hazard to the facility or workers, to minimize the amount of gasoline released onto the waterway. The other safety concern expressed was the potential for gasoline to become trapped under piers and docks creating the potential for other explosive conditions.The two pipelines from the facility to the pier that were ruptured contained about 150,000 gallons each from the value to the end. One was on fire and the other leaking onto the facility.At 1530 the SSC and a MSRC representative went on an overflight of the area on a USCG helicopter. The SSC took video footage and digital photographs of the event as well as mapping the extent and quantity of oil observed in the Arthur Kill. At the time of the flight the tide was ebbing to the south. Oil was noted at the entrance to the Kills, for the most part remaining in the center of the waterway. The gasoline was mostly rainbow and gray sheens extending up to the facility. North of the site there were two other sheens noted, one probably leaching from the landfill site and another mystery sheen. The smoke plume was very visible. It wafted up about 125 feet to 300 feet and northward over Staten Island. The SSC returned to the command post and presented the video and observations to the unified command. The gasoline was for the most part non-recoverable. It was estimated that the amount observed was in the thousands of gallons, not tens of thousand or hundreds of thousands. Most of the fuel spilled was consumed in the fire or evaporated.The SSC notified Tri-State Bird Rescue of the spill and potential for oiled birds. No birds were found to be oiled.The SSC also converted video footage taken by the Vessel Traffic Service into a digital format for distribution to the media and investigating agencies.22 February 2003 ? The SSC was supposed to participate in a first light overflight with the USCG. However, the rain and fog prohibited the aircraft from flying. At the 0800 unified command meeting a situation update was given. The manifold was still burning and would be attempted to inert and cap that morning. Joint investigations were underway by the NYC Fire Department Fire Marshals, Police Department Arson Investigations, US Coast Guard, and National Transportation Safety Board. The investigators were attempting to map the location of all of the debris. DonJon Marine was preparing a salvage plan. The Kills were still under one-way traffic with tug escorts. A sight safety plan was in place. NOAA was requested to continue weather updated for the next couple of days.The SSC participated in a news interview with the Staten Island Advance.Shoreline assessment teams reported seen sparse sheens off shore. They describe them as literally ""evaporating before our eyes."" Heavy rains and wind were the weather of the day.The SSC was contacted by the Coney Island Aquarium concerning the possibility of gasoline entering their water intakes.

The barge was loaded with 56,000 barrels (2,352,000 gallons) and had a draft of 17.9 feet. It struck a rock charted at 18 feet mean low water. Due to the stage of the moon, falling tide, and offshore winds the water depth over the rock was minimal. The tug was hugging the CT coast to stay in the lee of winds from the NW as it headed to its destination in Port Jefferson, NY. The barge was taken to a nearby location (41deg 02.6 N / 73deg 22.053 W) and anchored.The NOAA Scientific Support Team provided the USCG initial trajectory and oil weathering information, weather, tides, and resources at risk summary.At about 0800 the CT Department of Aquaculture closed the shellfish beds in all waters in the Norwalk, Darien, and Westport area until further notice.The divers survey discovered 14 cracks and holes in all six starboard tank bottoms. The original estimate of cargo loss by the naval architect was 450 barrels (18,900 gallons). Two morning overflights (0900 and 1200) by USCG personnel spotted an oil slick extending several miles from the barge. A relief barge arrived along side the holed barge at about 1400. At 1600 the SSC, RP rep and USCG FOSC went on an overflight in a helicopter. A sheen consisting of light rainbow to silver and gray was observed several miles from the barge. It measured about 3.5 miles long by 200 yards wide at the leading edge and 600 yards wide at the trailing end. The rest of LI Sound was search and not other oil was located. The overflight also mapped locations of ice along the LI coastline. A new trajectory model was developed based on the GPS positions of the slick.With the updated oil trajectory model showing land impacts on the northern Long Island coast plans were made to pre-position protective boom as several location near identified sensitive areas.By the evening meeting at 1800 the revised estimate of lost oil was downgraded to about 53 barrels (2,226 gallons). This estimate was within the range of oil observed on the afternoon overflight.Plans were made to begin over-the-top lightering operation during the first night, but due to logistics and operational constraints they were unable to begin until later the morning of the 15th. On 2/15 the morning overflight only spotted one small streamer of light silver and gray sheen within the area predicted by the trajectory model. The stern starboard quarter of the barge was seen to be awash. No oil was observed near the barge or anywhere near the LI coast. Almost all of the oil had evaporated and naturally dispersed.The NOAA modelers were requested to provide a ?Worst Case Discharge"" trajectory for a possible release from the barge on Saturday evening or Sunday morning. The new model indicated potential land impacts on LI more westerly than the oil that was initially released.Based on the updated weather forecasts for significantly worsening weather, the Unified Command decided to move the barge into Bridgeport harbor for safe haven to make temporary repairs and off-load the cargo. At present, as of 1800 this evening (2/15) the barge is in route to Bridgeport. Travel time is anticipated to be about 5 hours at two knots.

The SSC recommended that overflights and SCAT patrols look on the inside of the coastal inlets, as oil might have migrated inside the bay areas on incoming flood tides. Cleanup recommendations and bird recovery and rehabilitation strategies were also discussed. The NOAA Damage Assessment Coordinator was also notified. The NMFS noted that a number of seals (Harbor, harp, hooded, and grey) may be in the area. So far there have been about 20 birds affected (both dead and for rehab). Species include cormorants, ganets, seagulls, and red-throated loons. Manual cleanup operations were underway. With the impending storm cleanup efforts were focused on removal of the gross oil (larger tarballs and patties). Assessments after the storm passes were made to determine the need for further cleanup. There has been no identified source of the oil. The USCG Districts 1 and 5 have passed the word to all units to be on the lookout for any suspect vessels. Samples of the tarballs have been sent to the USCG Oil Identification Lab in Groton, CT for fingerprinting. The SSC brought up the point that the source may also be one of the many sunken tankers off the coast. USCG aircraft expanded their search further offshore in an attempt to spot any subsurface sources. There had been fairly high local media interest both in the New York and Philadelphia areas as well as from local NJ community press. NOAA trajectory modelers investigated the possibility of performing a hindcast to determine where the source of the oil may have likely originated. This was difficult and depend on the ability of the NWS to provide accurate local weather data for the last 10 days, as well as good current data."

Since the event had just happen, the initial report was sketchy and limited to the location (29? 08.57' N Lat. 094? 40.20' W Long.), vessel name (Bonita), and preliminary situation (explosion - details unknown).  The NOAA SSC contacted the HAZMAT Duty Officer who arranged for ""Home Team"" scientific support.  Given the high probability of loss of diesel fuel and lube oils on board the vessel and the possibility of an uncontrolled well blow-out, the SSC requested that the event be addressed as a potential major release.	Weather forecast and trajectory implications were developed by the NOAA HAZMAT Home Team and verbally communicated to the USCG.  Given the forecast on an approaching winter frontal passage and the distance off-shore (25 plus miles), no landfall of oil was forecast for the next several days.  Any diesel fuel released would not persist more than a couple of miles from the release point due to the chemical nature of diesel oil and relative high seas (4-5').  The SSC also consulted with the Texas State SSC relative to trajectory implications.  	At approximately 2100 hrs, the USCG called to update the situation:  The lift boat did explode.  The cause of the explosion is still under investigation.  Six people were injured (broken bones and burns), but at this point, no fatalities.  The sub-sea safety valve was shut preventing any release from the well, and the well was reported to only be producing water at the time of the explosion.  This is still preliminary information, but the USCG was confident that there was no apparent well release based on confirming observations from a USCG vessel on-scene.  The lift boat was damaged, but the fuel tanks were reported to be intact.  Given the updated situation and the low probability of shoreline impacts from any minor release, the NOAA team is standing-down, but remains on stand by.  USCG district 8."

The spill was the result of heavy rains and a ""weak"" containment dike (this is a simplified characterization of the problem).  One report estimated 35,000 lbs of phosphoric acid diluted into a ""million"" gallons of water was released into a small ditch which eventually emptied into the Houston Ship Channel.  A verbal assessment of the behavior of the chemical and possible risks was provided after contacting Dr. Ed Overton at LSU for his chemistry prospective and a review of the CAMEO data.  	Water monitoring had already began using a pH meter.  The verbal results passed to the SSC indicated that the ditch was at pH 2 (bottom of the acid scale).  However, within 40 feet of entering the ship channel, the values were neutral or background.  These may have only been surface readings, so a recommendation was made that a bottom pH profile be taken.  This is because concentrated solutions of phosphoric acid are more dense than water and would initially sink.  Source control had reduced addition drainage from the site to a ""trickle.""   A fish kill is possible (probable).  A similar release in the same location, but of a much larger volume (45,000,000 gallons), was reported to have caused a major fish kill in 1992.

The NOAA SSC responded on-scene and briefed the USCG Port Captain on the information provided by the NOAA Scientific Support Team in Seattle, WA (the Home Team).As more information became available, the probable cause of the incident shifted to an explosion of a gas drying system immediately adjacent to the well head.  The explosion knocked off the Christmas tree, but immediately (with 5-10 seconds) the subsurface safety system engaged shutting in the line and preventing further release of gas and oil (the system worked as designed).

The spill was the result of a decoupling (pipe separation) at Mississippi Canyon 538 (N 28? 23.32 Lat. W 89? 27.12 Long.).  The spill volume is reported as 240 bbl.  The spill was reported at 1415 hrs CST and source control by reattachment of BOP was reported at 1800 hrs.  The spilled oil is relatively heavy with an API of only 20.2.  Such oils are generally persistent and often form emulsified oil patties and tarballs which can travel long distances.  Often oil released under such conditions is already emulsified with formation or production water.  Dispersants are being evaluated, but would not be practical for a highly emulsified oil.  Conditions off-shore are good for mechanical recovery, and two skimmers are heading to the location.  Given the distance off-shore, landfall is not predicted over the next 2-3 days.

However, divers discovered that the ship's aft portion was resting on a flat rock.  After removing  much of the log cargo, the initial attempt to refloat the vessel occurred on the lower high tide, the evening of February 26 using the two small tugs that were available at the logging camp.    This effort was unsuccessful.  Two larger tugs, dispatched from Juneau, and were due to arrive on-scene the morning of February 27.   Due to crew fatigue and the two larger tugs not being in position, no attempt was made on the morning higher high tide on February 27.

The four barges had broken loose from the towboat and three were fully involved in fire.  An unknown amount of gasoline was leaking into the river.  Barges are lashed together and are located at mile 14.5.  Total product onboard the four barges was 70,000 bbl (2,940,000 gallons) of gasoline.  NOAA was asked to provided scientific support relative to possible fate scenarios and resources at risk.  The river was at normal-to-low water levels, and well within its banks.  Therefore, the resources of greatest risk are those in the river itself.  Gasoline is expected to completely evaporate, so the risk to aquatic resources is from acute toxicity from exposure to the highly soluble toxic fractions and near the source.  Transport down river was not expected to be uniform.  Gasoline could collect in eddies and oxbows, and present a potential for downstream localized hazards.  In these collection areas, the gasoline could also absorb to available organic material.  In addition, a local toxic shock to biota in shallow nearby areas was possible.  Pallid sturgeon (a listed endangered species) were present in the river, but were predicted to be concentrate at the control structure (upstream of the release site and not at significant risk).  Other rare species thought present in the river at the time of the incident were paddlefish and blue suckers.  These fish are highly mobile able to avoid exposures that would result in death.  Exceptions might be to juvenile fish in shallow areas close to the shoreline.  The greatest risk was to the commercial fishery.  An estimated 25-30 commercial fishermen worked the stretch threatened.  Commercial fisheries at risk included buffalo, freshwater drum, and several species of catfish.  Other resources present in the area included eagles and wading bird colonies.  For two days the barges were allowed to burn.  When the fire significant subsided, fire suppression experts attached the fire with water and foam.  The barges were then allowed to cool and possible reignition minimized by a foam blanket.  All barges were lightered and moved off scene by the evening of 28 February.  Only a ""negligible amount"" of gasoline was thought lost downstream.  USCG district 8."

The cause of the release is still under investigation.  Between 850 and 1200 bbls of a deep well production oil was released.  The oil was identified as MARS Blend, a relatively high sulfur, low asphaltene crude oil.  The initial trajectory predicted the oil would move south of Four Bayous pass and sustained north winds would move most of the oil offshore.  The winds were less than the forecast and the spill coincided with a spring tide (not the season Spring, but the description of the time in the tide cycle characterized by the greatest high and low tides, derived from spring up or rise).  Much of the oil moved back into Four Bayous and Barataria Pass.  The next morning.  Heavy concentrations of oil were observed on shorelines and on water.  The NOAA SSC participated in a morning overflight (pre-SCAT survey) on Thanksgiving morning to delineate oiled shorelines and surface oil.  Heavy surface oil concentrations north of Grand Terre and south of Four Bayous Pass were identified and skimmers repositioned.  Heavy oil was observed on the barrier islands of Barataria Bay.  The barrier islands impacted were Elmer's Island, Grand Isle, Grand Terre, and East Grand Terre.  The latter two were the heaviest impacted and the most remote (no road access).  Stranded oil was heaviest near the passes and on the eastern end of each island.  At least one marina at Grand Isle was impacted.	By Friday (two days after the spill), overflights looked encouraging.  Very little oil was visually observed on the beaches and on-water sheens were significantly reduced; unfortunately, most of the oil was buried by depositional sand and the lower tide level was preventing remobilization of stranded oil.  	The SCAT team used the aerial pre-SCAT survey to aid shoreline assessments since the heavily oiled beach areas were previously identified, but now mostly hidden by over-laying sand.  SCAT was an essential element in the response and used by the Unified Command to define areas which required cleanup as well as monitoring cleanup activities to insure that the cleanup recommendations were both adequate and adhered to by field crews.

The vessel sank in 30 feet of water, 6-8 miles west of the pass entrance.  The vessel was reported to have approximately 7000 gallons of diesel fuel oil and 30 gallons of lube oil onboard.  The amount released was unknown.  Subsequent USCG overflights observed no visible sheens associated with the fishing vessel.  Since no sheens were observed, there was reason to suspect that a majority of the diesel fuel was still on-board.  The USCG considered the sunken vessel a hazard to both navigation and the environment.  While diesel is generally considered a nonpersistant oil with a relatively high evaporation rate and natural dispersion rate, most diesel fuel oils are, at the same time, highly toxic.  The NOAA SSC was asked to provide information to assess potential spill trajectories and possible environmental affects related to the sunken fishing boat.  NOAA also provided an evaluation of potential damages under possible spill scenarios using the Type A Model.

On-scene conditions were 55-knot winds, 30-foot seas, snow, icing conditions, and 1/4 nm visibility.  The quantity of logs was quite large-200 to 400 log bundles of 80 to 100 logs per bundle.  The logs were 41 to 45 feet long and 4 to 15 inches in diameter; each bundle weighed approximate 27 tons.  The USCG deemed these logs a hazard to navigation of TAPS tankers, container vessels, and maritime traffic in the GOA.  Initially the logs were in MSO Juneau's zone and, along with the Seventeenth District Coast Guard Operations Center in Juneau, requested that NOAA provide weather forecasts and predict trajectories of the logs to monitor the position of the logs help their C-130 overflights.  NOAA's initial report to the USCG was that the trajectory of the logs will continue west-southwest at 2% of the wind speed (0.5 knots) until they cross the 100-fathom curve where they will encounter the Alaska Current and begin moving in a west-northwest direction at approximately the same speed.Due to the severe weather, many of the log bundles broke apart making it very difficult for ships' radar to see this debris.  The weather was not cooperative and overflights could be conducted only every 3 to 5 days.  As location reports came in, they were forwarded to NOAA in Seattle who then used this information to provide a search location for the next overflight.  The Alaska Stream occupies this portion of the GOA and moves from east to west and the logs were gradually dispersed and carried west-northwest toward the central GOA.  As the logs moved west, MSO Valdez became involved in the tracking effort and served to coordinate information flowing to and from USCG Kodiak Air Station who was conducting the overflights.

Phone calls soon began to filter into the local fire station describing a strong diesel smell within a cluster of homes at Scottish Pike in South Knoxville, Tennessee.   When a fire truck arrived on-scene, a fountain of diesel fuel was spewing heavily onto an adjacent house and an immediate evacuation of six homes took place.   At the same time notification to shut down its pipeline was given to Colonial Pipeline (RP).  They were also told to boom off Goose Creek, at the junction of the creek and the Lake.  The diesel had flowed down an embankment to Goose Creek then into the lake and river creating a slick 60 feet wide  and several miles long.  The USCG was notified and dispatched a team from MSD Nashville and three members of the USCG GST.  EPA arrived on-scene the morning of February 13 and assumed the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) position since the spill originated from shore.  The cause of the spill will be investigated by the National Transit Safety Board (NTSB).  The spill occurred at river mile (RM) 647.5, which is below the City of Knoxville's  water intakes.  Additionally the river is controlled by a dam ( Fort Loudoun Lake Dam) that shut down operations soon after notification of the spill.  By midmorning the RP and contracted response organizations had boomed off three locations down river.  Because it was dyed red the diesel produced a very noticeable slick. The current in the area was flowing at 1 knot and a little faster in the river bend just a couple of miles downstream from Goose Creek in the area called Sequoyah Hills.  From there the river opens up wider and the current drops off significantly.   As the diesel spread out, rainbow sheens developed.  This was prevalent between Sequoyah Hills and a mile down river to Looney Island.  As the spilled diesel weathered, silver sheens became more prevalent after day two and even more on day three.  Additionally silver steaks could be seen from the air  leeching off a point at RM 645.  South of Looney Island to Sequoyah Park the diesel was observed to be in streaks and patches.  On shore the diesel penetrated deep into the riprap shorelines and maybe an inch into the fine-grain sand shores from Goose Creek to Sequoyah Hills.  Oil film and a brown frothy mousse could be seen downstream of Sequoyah Hills. Additional shoreline impacts were at the booming site at Sequoyah Park where unweathered diesel pooled at the junction of the boom and shoreline.  Some oiled debris was located at RM 639 near Maxey's Boat Dock.  Fortunately half the area is guarded by bedrock bluffs resulting in less shoreline impact and probably accounted for a high percentage of recovery noted by the RP.  Officially, 45,000 gallons of diesel was released and 90% was recovered by skimmers and vacuum trucks.  The initial report of the spill indicated that there had been 80,000 gallons of diesel released.  In which case the mass balance breaks down to 50% recovered, 30% evaporated, 15% Goose Creek soils, and 5% other shoreline impacts.  USCG district 8.

The spilled oil was a condensate crude with an API of 38.  The stretch of shoreline from Galveston to Freeport is historically an area with high concentrations of birds.  In particular, the area around San Luis Pass is an important feeding and loafing area for shorebirds, gulls, terns, loons, pelicans, and wading birds.  At the time of the spill, because of the very early spring weather, many birds were staging along the beaches, particularly shorebirds who are feeding to bulk up for the migration to nesting areas.  Though shorebirds have a lower tendency to get oiled (compared to diving birds who spend much of their time on the water surface or diving for prey) they spend a lot of time feeding at the water/land interface where any tarballs that come ashore are likely to concentrate.  With onshore winds, the ultimate fate of any persistent oil was shoreline stranding.  Normally, tarballs on shore are not an issue because they are easy to clean up.  However, because of the high concentrations of birds present in the area of the predicted impact, there was a risk of birds getting oiled.  USCG district 8.  Keyword: boom, Corexit 9500."

Heavy surf and high winds throughout the next several days made boarding the vessel difficult and dangerous. While the preferred option was to salvage the vessel with the oil on board, the Unified Command requested that contingency plans for vessel lightering, cleanup and pollution response be developed. The longer the ship remained grounded, the greater the risk of it leaking its load of nearly 400,000 gallons of fuel oil. Moreover, a small group of endangered snowy plover was located approximately 800 yards south of the vessel.  In fact, on February 8, shipboard personnel observed oil burping out alongside the ship from a small crack in the hull and on the beach near the ship.

The NOAA trajectory doesn't anticipate any landfall within the next three days (the duration of the trajectory forecast).  In general, given the type of oil, quantity spilled, and current offshore weather and ocean currents, the potential for observable beach oiling is very low.  Nearly half of the oil will evaporate and the rest will form small tarballs.  The later are very persistent and may travel many hundreds of miles, but will probably be so highly spatially dispersed that they will be virtually undetected.  They will be lost among the background tarball population of the Gulf of Mexico.  Tarballs in the Gulf of Mexico are derived from both natural seeps and anthropogenic spills.

The report was that four slicks of thick light brown oil extended for a distance of ten miles north of the above position.  The northern end of the slick was a ""diesel like"" sheen.The SSC consulted with Jerry Galt and Glen Watabayashi of NOAA HAZMAT in Seattle and provided the Coast Guard with a verbal trajectory.  Seattle HAZMAT used the Texas General Land Office's (TGLO) TABS buoy system current information as well as current and forecasted weather information to evaluate the situation.  It was determined that the slick would most likely move to the WNW of the reported position at approximately 1/3 to 1/2 of a knot.  The reported position was as of 1730 on Saturday afternoon and due to logistical constraints the MSU was unable to schedule an overflight until Sunday afternoon.  In this interim the slick could be expected to move 10 miles to the WNW.On Sunday afternoon the Coast Guard conducted an overflight and with the trajectory information provided, they were able to successfully locate the slick.  The overflight revealed a 200 x 200 yard slick of light brown oil which was somewhat patchy.  It is believed that either the initial report overestimated the amount of product or the majority had already evaporated.  Due to the distance offshore (100 miles) and the small amount of product no further response was warranted.  USCG district 8."

PHONE (206) 526-6317. - _ - Per your request we have looked at trajectory implications of the urea that has been released from the barge Alaska.  These notes are based on the following information:-  - A barge located at 56? 28'N, 132? 23'W (Wrangell, Alaska) is reported to have cracks in the starboard and portside.  The vessel is carrying an unknown amount of urea stored as a bulk product.  At this time, the vessel is not leaking product.-  - If any of this initial information is incorrect, please let us know ASAP as it would affect any trajectory implications. - _ - 1) WEATHER - Today, the winds are forecast from the south at 30 knots with rain.  Tomorrow, the rain is expected to continue with winds from the south at 25 knots. -  - 2) GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF UREA - Urea is a white crystal or powder with very faint odor. It has a density of 1.3 (it would sink in water) and is soluble in water. Urea is commonly present in nature, in urine and other body fluid. As a fertilizer, urea contains 45-46% nitrogen, and is usually in the form of small pellets or granules. It is shipped in bags or in bulk.  -  - 3) TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS - The harbor is generally shallow and is rapidly flushed due to tidal action.  Any dissolved product will be quickly diluted by water exchange through the harbor entrance.  The dissolved urea will not affect the pH of the water much, the effect, if there is any, will be localized, and given the tidal current present any effect will quickly dissipated because of the flushing effect in the harbor. -  - 4)FATE AND EFFECT OF UREA - Solubility - Urea is very soluble in water.  In the case of a capsized vessel, the urea pellets will sink to the ocean floor while  dissolving in the water column. Water currents facilitate the dissolution process of urea in the same way that stirring a cup of coffee helps dissolve the sugar faster. Since the urea was stored in bulk, the granules may disperse as a ""cloud"" of fertilizer, each granule sinking independently while coming in full contact with the water. - Effect on pH - When urea dissolves in water it forms a weak base. The pH of the ocean water varies between 6.5 to 8.5. Usually it tends to be somewhat basic. In addition, the ocean has a substantial buffering capacity. In the past even large urea spills had minimal effect on the pH and we would expect the similar process during this incident. - Effect on the environment - We would not expect to see any algae bloom or other nutrient driven changes. The spilled urea dissolves quickly, eventually turning into carbon dioxide which escapes as gas and dissipates, and ammonia, which dilutes in the prevailing tidal current and quickly drops to ambient concentration. It is quite possible that the concentration of available nitrogen (in the form of ammonia) may be elevated for a short period of time at the immediate location of the spill. However, considering the rapid dilution and dispersion into the water column, exposure to organisms is predicted to be short-term. The biological literature focuses on phytoplankton effects and these seem to be mediated by light.  At this time of the year, the phytoplankton population is relatively small, and the amount of daylight minimal.  Adverse effects are expected to be minimal and confined to the harbor.

In addition, it was agreed that any attempt at protection strategies would prove pointless, given the heavy surf.  The FOSC considered sending divers to close the vents.  It was agreed that, if the vessel was in 200+ feet of water, such an operation would be unnecessarily risky to the divers. -  - On the morning (11/3/97) overflight, no sheen was sighted.  The vessel's owner had determined the depth of the vessel at 140 feet and had decided to send hard-hat divers to begin salvage operations.While the divers are on-station, they will close the vents to prevent any further release.  The diving operation will begin Tuesday (11/4/97), weather permitting.

It is possible that the release was gradual over the course of weeks or months until the material released reached a level that caused a visible reaction in the waters of the barge canal.  The spill site is actually two water bodies; an industrial barge canal in Bienville Industrial Park and a freshwater riverine/marsh habitat in the adjacent Mulatto Bayou.

Ferrous sulfate is reacted in a controlled situation by Eaglebrook to make a flocculating agent used in wastewater treatment.

The river overtopped its banks, cutoff a meandering loop, and scoured a new channel through a normally dry area containing pipelines.  As a result of the flooding, Houston had been declared a National Disaster Area and the estuarine environments of Galveston Bay were stressed because of the influx of fresh floodwaters.   As the flood waters began to recede, pipelines began to rupture.It was surmised that large debris or some barges had broken free and were caught in the high-river currents and collided with the pipelines, causing four of them to rupture.  It is also possible that the new channel cut by the flooded river may have undercut the pipeline supports, which were not designed for water crossing.   The ruptured pipelines contained gasoline, crude oil, heating oil, and natural gas.  Within hours of the ruptures, the spilled products ignited and, already caught up in the flood waters, become a burning mass moving downstream.  The fires destroyed many homes along the river banks.

At 2135 on July 19 it was reported that oil had breached the containment boom and 200 to 300 barrels were in the water.  It was believed that while offloading the cargo in the damaged tank, the water-bottom was upset allowing the oil to escape.Mobil response team personnel boomed the vessel.  The Delaware Bay and River Cooperative (DBRC) launched two skimmers and boomed several pre-identified creeks nearby.  Marine Spill Response Corporation (MSRC) responded with its skimming vessel (Delaware Responder).  Three additional contractors were hired for the cleanup and a field command post was established at the Mobil refinery.The USCG COTP Philadelphia assumed the FOSC role for this incident. USCG personnel were onscene to monitor cleanup activities.  The OSC requested two forward-looking infrared radar (FLIR) overflights (one during the night of July 19; the other the next morning) to help identify the extent of oil migration in the river.

The barge was in tow from Toledo, Ohio to Cleveland, Ohio carrying 1,013,325 gallons of No. 6 Fuel Oil.  In 1961, the Army Corps of Engineers supervised a salvage operation to raise the barge from its original location, move it clear of the shipping lanes, and resink it in 70 feet of water.  Records showed that the barge, currently resting keel up,  could still contain up to 800,000 gallons of product in 5 of its 6 tanks.  The COTP federalized the incident after divers observed an ounce of oil leaking out of a 1.5 inch valve every 13 minutes.  This leak was plugged on 16 July and an inspection of all exposed valves on the hull was conducted.

The power plant is approximately two miles downriver of the Ambassador Bridge in Detroit.  The leak was continuous and occurred from approximately 2230 on February 9 to 0330 on February 10 and was described as flowing at the rate of a fire-hose discharge.  Oil had broken through a corroded portion of a 10-inch supply line, ran into a storm sewer, and then traveled about 100 feet to enter the river.  When the incident occurred, the Detroit River was 95 percent ice-covered.Originally the released product was thought to be a #6 oil, but laboratory analysis proved it was a #4 fuel with density of 0.93.  The original estimate of 10,000 to 30,000 gallons proved a conundrum as only about 300 gallons was observed in the river.  Later volume refinements had the number at officially  less than 900 gallons and most likely around 300 gallons.  The City of Detroit assumed responsibility for the spill and immediately hired Marine Pollution Control.  Only a limited response was possible due to the ice.  A portion of the spilled oiled was recovered by removing the oil-stained ice accessible from the shorelines.  The Detroit City Laboratory performed the first analysis on the oil, determining that it was a #4 rather than a #6, and that it was a ""floater"".  The City immediately hired Tri-State Bird Rescue to assess the threat to nearly 5000 birds in the oiled area and to establish a rehabilitation center, if necessary.The Joint U.S./Canada contingency plan was invoked and a unified command was formed among the USCG, the City of Detroit, the State of Michigan, and the Canadian Coast Guard.  All activities took place at the MSO Detroit office.The active response lasted for only four days.  On the fifth and sixth days, the temperature rose into the 40s and the wind shifted to from the east allowing more of the oil-stained ice to migrate to the shoreline where it could be removed.

Berman went aground in the surf zone off Escambron Beach in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The barge grounded on a hard bottom consisting of rocky substrate with scattered coral after its towing cable parted.The barge had a capacity of three million gallons but was reportedly only half full.  The cargo, a heavy #6 fuel oil, began spilling and impacted nearby shoreline and shallow intertidal habitats immediately.  No estimated leakage rate was available.  Due to strong northerly winds, the surf at the grounding site was quite strong creating a hazardous situation as they pounded the deck of the vessel. The responsible party initially assumed responsibility for the spill, but very quickly expended the ten million dollar limit of their insurance policy.  Full federal funding of the spill occurred at 0600 on January 14 and it became a United States Coast Guard (USCG) directed response.The USCG Gulf Strike Team (GST) was brought onscene and immediately began lightering operations for the barge.  Skimming and lightering operations were effective and removed an estimated 17,700 barrels of oil from the water and leaking barge.  Shoreline cleanup and assessment began almost immediately.  Little progress was made however due to continued leaking of fresh oil from the barge.  Cleaned areas became re-oiled and areas not yet cleaned became more heavily impacted.  Protection strategies were employed for areas at risk that were not yet oiled.  Intensive shoreline cleanup was postponed for the most heavily impacted areas until the sources of re-oiling could be stopped.  Two shallow lagoons near the grounding site were most heavily impacted.  Oil, in the form of large mats, accumulated on the surface and on the bottom of the lagoons.  Submerged oil posed a major cleanup problem during the response.  It was eventually partially removed by divers, vacuum transfer units, and a dredge.  Waste and oily water from dredging operations were collected and separated in a series of swimming pools arranged to decant and filter the effluent from the dredge before returning the filtered water to the sea. On January 15, the barge was refloated, towed to a scuttling site 20 miles northeast of San Juan, and sunk.  This operation was carefully reviewed by the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC), Navy Superintendent of Salvage (SUPSALV), the GST, and NOAA.  The Regional Response Team (RRT) was consulted and on-scene trustee representatives were given an opportunity to discuss the operation and voice their concerns.  It was agreed by all that the sinking of the barge was the best alternative.  Continued re-oiling of the nearshore environment from the unrecoverable oil left onboard was delaying cleanup and preventing resource recovery.  Resource concerns offshore were minimal and it was hoped that the amount of residual oil left on the barge when it sank would be small and have little impact.  Shorelines at risk from any oil released during the scuttling operations were predicted to be on northwestern Puerto Rico, Mona Island, and Hispaniola.Shoreline cleaning continued in earnest and was more successful with the barge removed.  Surface and buried oil along sand beaches was removed following cleanup guidelines.  Beachrock, riprap, and seawalls were cleaned with pressure washing and chemical cleaners as approved.  Some inaccessible areas were left to clean naturally.  Cleanup guidelines for oiled historical structures were developed and approved by trustees through the Heritage Resource Team.  These structures and resources were then cleaned according to those guidelines.On February 3, oil impacts along northwestern Puerto Rico were reported.  A convergence zone at the northwest corner of the island concentrated debris and oil still being released from the scuttled barge.  Impacts were primarily along 12 miles of shoreline, from Isabella to Borinquen.  This oil was buried as oily sand layers and submerged as oil and sand mats in the protected areas or crenulate bays.  A separate command post was established on the west end of the island and assessments and cleanup operations began immediately.  Crews removed the stranded oil quickly to prevent additional burial.  Cleanup efforts were intensified in this area to minimize risks to nesting sea turtles, whose arrival was imminent. All necessary cleanup guidelines and inspection criteria were in place by mid-February.  With the exception of nearshore reef fish and benthic organisms near the barge's grounding site, there were very few impacts to biological resources.   Seagrasses were oiled near the grounding site.  Very few birds were affected and no substantiated reports of spill related mortalities to reptiles or mammals were received.  The impacted shoreline was divided into 18 shoreline segments or zones.  Most of these zones were cleaned and inspected following the ""how clean is clean"" guidelines, and approved by the FOSC by April 4.  All other zones were signed off by April 25, with the exception of zone 18, which was completed on May 27.  Once approved as clean, each zone entered a monitoring and maintenance phase to address any additional oiling that may occur.  USCG district 7.  Keyword: endangered species, bioremediation."

The failure occurred below the ground near a pipe junction on the east side of Harbor Boulevard just south of Ventura, California.  Approximately 2,000 barrels of a heavy crude produced from a local field, percolated through the ground to the west and underneath the road.  The oil surfaced 50 yards west of Harbor Boulevard and entered a creek,  traveled along this creek approximately 150 yards to the south where it entered McGrath Lake.McGrath is a freshwater lake (approximately 800 by 100 yards) situated amongst medium-coarse grained sand dunes and is located 100 to 200 yards inshore of the intertidal zone.  The lake serves as a drainage basin for the surrounding agricultural fields and has no natural communication with the ocean.  To control the lake level, water is routinely pumped out of the lake and into the Pacific Ocean through a pipeline running through the dunes and onto the beach.  When the oil entered the lake, the pump was on and oil was discharged onto the sand beach and into the nearshore environment.  Less than 100 barrels of oil entered the ocean; the majority was contained in the lake, the creek, or was saturated in the sediment.The mouth of the Santa Clara river was bermed to prevent oil from entering the estuary.  To control the amount of water flowing through the spill site, water was diverted from the creek to the Santa Clara River via pumps.  Underflow dams and filter fences with sorbent pompoms were installed along the creek.  The vegetated shoreline of the creek and the lake, consisting mostly of tules, was heavily coated with oil.  Because all pumping operations had ceased, the water level in the lake was rising and began covering over already impacted shoreline and affecting more habitat as it rose.  After consulting with the Regional Water Quality Control Board, pumping the lake into the ocean began again and the water level was lowered to where it had been before the spill.  USCG district 11.

MSO Tampa closed the port to vessel traffic.  This collision caused three separate emergencies:  1) the Balsa 37,  which was carrying a cargo of phosphate rock, was severely damaged on the starboard side, was listing at an increasing rate, and was in danger of capsizing in the channel; 2) the Ocean 255, which was loaded with jet fuel, gasoline, and a small amount of diesel fuel was burning out of control just south of Mullet Key; and 3) the Bouchard 155  was holed at the port bow spilling approximately 8,000 barrels of #6 fuel oil into Tampa Bay.Stabilizing the vessels was the first priority of responders.  By 2200 the Ocean 255 barge fire was extinguished and the GST was conducting cooling procedures and maintaining a fire watch.  Lightering operations were well underway on the Bouchard 155 barge in preparation for moving it to dockage in the Port of Tampa where it would be cleaned before dry docking.  The Balsa 37 was intentionally grounded outside the shipping channel to prevent it from capsizing and to open the channel for traffic while repairs and stability evaluations were conducted.August 10 overflight observations showed a three- to six-meter wide band of oil along the beaches.  By the next day, this band appeared to be about half its original width.  Systematic shoreline surveys were conducted and oil was found buried by two to eight inches of clean sand deposited during high tide.  Cleanup crews focused on manually removing the band of surface oil high on the beach.  A plan was developed to remove the subsurface oil without generating large volumes of sediment for handling, disposal, and replacement.  The plan called for mechanical removal of the heavy buried layers, manual removal of moderately oiled sediments, and mechanically pushing stained sand onto the lower part of the beach for surf washing.  Pompoms were strung along the surf zone to collect any oil refloated during the surf washing.By August 11 the status of the vessels had improved substantially.  The response focus began to change from  emergency issues to skimming operations, protection strategies, forecasts, and planning.Meanwhile, cleanup crews were contending with very thick oil that had been deposited around some mangrove islands.  Tarmats formed when sediment was mixed with oil along the shallow flats surrounding the islands.  Large thick mats coated mangrove roots, oyster and seagrass beds, and tidal mud flats.  Most of this oil was vacuumed out using vacuum transfer units on grounded barges staged around the islands and shallow areas.  Seawalls within the bay were being washed using high-pressure water heated to 110 degrees.The GST was onscene throughout the spill response.  They provided support with the Vessel of Opportunity Skimming System as well as the fire fighting, monitoring, and lightering of the Ocean 255 barge.Roughly 14.5 miles of fine-grained sand beach from St. Petersburg Beach north to Redington Shores Beach were affected by this spill.  Sand beaches on Egmont Key at the entrance to Tampa Bay were also oiled.  Additionally, four mangrove islands inside the entrance to Boca Ciega Bay at Johns Pass and two small areas of Spartina marsh were oiled.  Jetties, seawalls, and riprap within the bay and at Johns Pass and Blind Pass were also oiled to varying degrees.  It is estimated that over 30 miles of residential seawalls were oiled within Boca Ciega Bay.  Some impact also occurred on the northern side of Mullet Key at Bonne Fortune Key in fringing mangroves.Seawalls, jetties, walkways, and riprap were cleaned by high-pressure hot-water washes.  PES-51 was considered for some of these cleaning needs, but after observing comparison tests performed by the manufacturer, the RP decided against its use.Cleanup of submerged tarmats offshore is ongoing.

Steuart Petroleum is located in the Jacksonville Port Terminal and the St. Johns River runs within 1,000 feet of it.The Jacksonville Fire Department responded to the fire and, in addition to land-side fire-fighting equipment, a fire-fighting boat was stationed on the St. Johns River as a precaution.The USCG COTP Jacksonville, closed the channel from the Trout River Inlet through the southern end of the Long Branch range the morning of January 2.  Later that day, the channel was opened to one-way traffic that was restricted to the east side.The fire department transferred product from the damaged tank to other tanks and the damaged tank was continuously cooled throughout the operation.  The fire was on top of the tank so the fire fighters blanketed that area with aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) attempting to smother the fire.  To maintain the integrity of the tank, water was continuously pumped into it keeping the level constant.  The resulting water-foam mixture was pumped from the berm area into the St. Johns River to sustain the necessary berm containment volume from January 4 until January 7 when the fire department declared the fire out.On January 6, all water was drained from the tank and pure foam was introduced at both the top and bottom to completely extinguish the flames.

The vessel is headed for Baltimore from Houston with the cargo of Allyl Alcohol's ultimate  destination to be France.  SSC Gary Ott is on scene at MSO Hampton Roads.  The  initial evaluation by NOAA points out that although the material is poisonous,  flammability is the higher risk problem (flash point is 70 degrees Farhenheit), and further evaluations should be conducted with the measure of flammability as  a priority with the toxicity issue considered second in importance to that. The worst case scenario of a very large puddle of the material would have a IDLH  zone of 26 yards due to the low vapor pressure of Allyl Alcohol (17 mmHg at 20  degrees Celsius).  Allyl Alcohol is an intense irritant to the skin, eyes, nose  and throat, it causes burns on contact and is poisonous in small quantities. The lethal dose is approximately 1 ounce for a 150 lb. person. The material has good warning properties with extreme tearing of the eyes as an indicator. Other materials of a lower priority to be considered include P.Chlorobenzoyl Chloride of which there are 66 drums on the vessel.

The canal drains directly to the Cape Fear River constituting discharge of oil into U.S. waters.  Monitoring wells were placed near the site of the leaching to determine the extent and source of the plume.  Analysis of the groundwater monitoring data revealed a plume of oil that stretched from the site of leaching upslope below a nearby pump pit and below the nearest storage tank (tank 13).MSO Wilmington is responding to an oil pollution incident at the City Gas and Transmission Corp., Wilmington, NC, an abandoned oil and waste oil facility.  Oil is leaking at a low rate into a drainage ditch and then into the Cape Fear River. The responsible party has also terminated maintenance of a recovery well located about five feet from the edge of the drainage ditch.  Pumps had been used to remove floating oil from the well while depressing the local ground water level .  This had prevented oil from leaching into the drainage ditch. The facility has approximately 15-20 tanks with concrete bottoms. Some sludges in 55 gallon drums have been observed on the site. Oil contamination of soils and potential contamination of underground waters has been estimated as high as 100,000 gallons. (the methods used for this estimate are not known).

The spill was possibly from bilge pumping.  The identity of the spiller is unknown at this time.  The spilled waste oil is suspected to have been treated with bilge cleaner by the spiller. The spilled oil initially impacted approximately 2 miles of the south bank of the Neches River.  The impact was in pockets along the shoreline and had moderately impacted some marshy areas associated with the small pockets of oil. The salinity of the river water in the vicinity of the spill is estimated at 0.1 ppt (estimate made by MSO Port Arthur).  The  current in the area of the spill is estimated at no more than 0.5 kts. On October 16, MSO Port Arthur FOSC representative, LCDR Ross Tuxhorn was contacted by the NOAA SSC at the request of the CG District 8 Marine Safety Office representative, CDR Wieczynski. At that time the FOSCR stated the problem as noted above and further requested information related to a request by the Texas General Land Office to do an experiment on a designated area of the spill with Oil Spill Eater II (an enzyme product that is advertised as a biological dispersant.  This is one of ten products that have been chosen for testing by NETAC. After consulting with the NOAA Hazmat Biological Assessment Team (Rebecca Hoff), LSU (Charlie Henry), and RPI (Jeff Dahlin), the SSC relayed the information to the FOSC verbally.  The result of the conversation was that the recommendation was that this was not a proper type of oil, or a proper area to experiment with OSE II, and that it was recommended that the experiment not be carried out on this particular spill.  The details of the consultations were put in written form by LSU and RPI and these documents were  FAXed to the FOSC and the RRT-6 members on October 16. On October 17, the FOSCR accomplished a recon of the affected area and decided to change the locations of the areas to be used for an experiment to two drainage outlets that had been affected. these outlets are owned by Dupont.  There is an estimated 15-25 gallons of the waste oil remaining in these two outlets that would be treated with the OSE II. The above change in locations was mentioned at the conference call that took place on October 17 at 1230 CT.  During the call RRT members voiced concerns over the lack of an appropriate monitoring plan, the chemistry of the waste oil, the need to acquire the  approval of the land owner to test on Dupont land, and the lack of a plan to handle the treated product in the event of flooding that would require Dupont to empty the waste oil and product into the Neches River.

If a spill were to occur and persist over a tidal cycle, it is likely that both the inside and outside of northern Pea Island will be threatened.  If the diesel is released, there maybe a toxic shock to bivalves.

The grounding resulted in a crack in the vessel's hull from the manifold on the starboard side to 75 feet aft of the manifold on the port side.Area marinas were evacuated and vessel traffic was halted.  Bangor County Fire Department and USCG personnel arrived on-scene within 30 minutes of the incident.  The pier fire was extinguished in an attempt to save the last mooring line while the fire onboard the vessel remained out of control.  Williams Boots & Coots Company (WB&C) from Houston, Texas, was contracted to fight the fire due to the lack of locally available trained personnel and equipment.  At 1315 on September 17, WB&C personnel extinguished the blaze by applying foam.  Carbon black accumulations falling from the overhead re-ignited the fire at 2300.  This second blaze was cooled with water and extinguished with foam on September 18.  WB&C personnel also applied foam inside the vessel's cargo tanks to prevent re-ignition of the vessel.River flow data were obtained from the Army Corps of Engineers to predict the oil movement.  Shock waves from the explosion may have contributed to the deaths of several fish that were recovered from around the vessel.  Neither pollution nor shoreline contamination was observed during the final survey of the area on October 22.  USCG district 9.

NOAA reported that the shoreline is mostly sand beaches, gravel beaches, mixed sand and gravel beaches, and rocky shores or seawalls.  The offshore islands that are surrounded by mangroves would not be affected if the winds continued to be easterly.  NOAA estimated that the slick would tend to the west or northwest and would come ashore on beaches inshore and to the west of the facility.  This could have occurred for a considerable distance, depending on the weather conditions and local small-scale oceanographic circulation patterns.  There was a small chance that, with a large enough quantity of free-floating, unrestricted oil and continued easterly winds, the oil might round Punta Guayanilla and impact the beaches of Punta Verraco and Bahia de Guayanilla.  If this did happen, NOAA advised that the large mangrove forests of Bahia de Guayanilla be protected.  NOAA further advised that the oil would persist in the environment, with a small quantity evaporating during weathering.  Reef impacts would be low because the oil is not very soluble; there would probably be no impacts at all below the surface, although there could be severe shoreline impacts.   In addition, NOAA reported that the oil would strand at the high tide line and persist or wash away, depending on sand and gravel transport on that beach.  Finally, sticky, weathered bunker oil would adhere to rocky shores and mangroves, killing the mangroves when the oil got into the root system. Turtles currently nesting in Puerto Rico and along the sandy beaches of Punta Verraco were at risk.  Oiled adults would suffer irritated mucous membranes and would develop lesions that would probably result in an increased risk of infection.  Oiled hatchlings would probably die, whether they were on the beach or floating offshore.  Oiled turtle eggs and newly hatched turtles had a greater than 80% chance of mortality.  There were many species of birds present, including the brown pelican, a federally listed endangered species.  If oiled feathers remained untreated, the birds would die as a result of loss of insulation or ingestion of oil during preening.  The diving birds (brown pelican, brown booby, terns), wading birds  (herons and egrets), shorebirds (plovers, sandpipers), and ducks were the most likely to be affected because they would dive and wade into the oil slick.  Seabirds (magnificent frigate bird) and gulls skim the surface when feeding and would also be affected.  Large numbers of gulls would also be impacted.  USCG district 7."

Security measures were suggested to prevent tampering and further damage to the barges until the material within could be properly identified, safely removed and isolated for disposal.  ""Core"" samples from each tank and Level B personnel protection were also strongly recommended.  In addition, the SSC recommended that local and state water board, storm levy and canal lock officials be contacted to ensure immediate emergency response should waters from the spill site and Doullut Canal have to be isolated from the Mississippi River and the sensitive areas of Adams Bay and surrounding wetlands.  NOAA further advised the Coast Guard of the presence, year-round, of Eastern oyster in Adams Bay and Bastian Bay downstream, south and west of the site.  NOAA indicated that sample analysis results were not atypical of oil production wastes.  USCG district 8."

The OSC assumed federal responsibility for the spill response within two hours, following the determination that the incident was beyond the control of the ship's captain and the owners, Ballard Shipping of Monrovia, Liberia.  A $50,000 ceiling on the pollution fund was established, which was later raised to $3.4 million.  The OSC immediately hired cleanup contractors and requested boom and other cleanup equipment.  The COTP Providence established a 500 yard safety zone around the grounded vessel.The vessel was surrounded with three layers of containment boom.  The remaining cargo onboard was offloaded into barges beginning June 24.  The area within the boom was cleaned with skimmers beginning on June 26.

Dimethoate is a sulfur-containing compound with a mercaptin-like odor.  Its high molecular weight and low vapor pressure makes it quite stable in solid form at ambient temperatures, and its odor is noticeable even in extremely low concentrations.  NOAA hypothesized that some vapor from the solid dimethoate may have leaked into the closed container during shipment, and that it was this vapor that was detected while the vessel was en route to San Francisco.  The concentration in the atmosphere within the container was probably never at a toxic level even though it would have been uncomfortable to breathe.  Once the container was opened and exposed to circulating air, the detectable odor would dissipate rapidly.    NOAA recommended that personnel involved in the inspection of the shipping container be suited in Level B protection as a conservative measure as dimethoate does not present a significant inhalation hazard when shipped in solid form.  The primary concern with this product was to avoid inhalation or ingestion of airborne dust from a potentially damaged shipping container and to restrict dermal contact to minimize any chance of skin absorption.  A visual inspection of the container by the Coast Guard Marine Safety Office found no evidence of damage to the container or spillage of dimethoate.  Accordingly, the container was left aboard the vessel for continuation to the WAARDRECHT's destination in Mexico.   The case was closed after the container was inspected and found to be undamaged.

(UMTB) Tank Barge 283, towed by the tug Marine Explorer, began sinking stern down approximately 35 miles southeast of Simeonof Island, on the western side of the Gulf of Alaska.  The tug and barge, en route to Dutch Harbor with approximately 47,620 barrels of diesel on board, encountered extremely rough weather.  The pump room and starboard aft tanks, which had been empty, were now flooded, causing the barge to turn bow-up with approximately 80 feet of the barge above water and the remaining 200 feet below the surface.  The tug's crew members observed oil coming from the vicinity of the waste oil tanks in the stern area.  Although the barge owner speculated that the stern anchor had punctured the aft waste oil tank, the exact cause of the sinking was never determined.  The salvage vessel M/V Salvage Chief  hired by Seattle-based UMTB arrived on January 7 after an eight-day passage from Astoria, Oregon.  Meanwhile, the barge continued leaking diesel fuel as 50-60 knot winds and 20-25 foot seas pounded the area. The tug Salvage Chief arrived on-scene January 7 with divers and a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to investigate the bottom of the barge.  Small cracks found in the port and starboard main decks were sealed with wooden plugs.\\After considering all the options, UMTB asked the USCG for assistance in sinking the barge.  The barge was sunk by the USCG Cutter Sedge  at 1246 on January 13, 1989, approximately 11 miles southwest of the Semidi Islands at 55 48 N and 156 46 W.\\Due to the location of the spill, on-scene weather conditions, and the rate of oil leakage, no cleanup action was performed.By January 4, only 40 feet of the barge's bow remained above the surface.  From the attitude of the barge, the owner's naval architects and salvage master speculated that four tanks remained filled with diesel fuel while the other tank's cargo was displaced by water.Initially, the owner requested resource agency clearance to move the barge to Stepovak Bay for lightering and repair operations.  As the barge, with the tug and tow line still attached, drifted northeast parallel to the coast, evaluations of Stepovak, Castle, Devil's, and Kuiukta bays, along the southeastern side of the Alaska Peninsula, were requested of NOAA.  The upright-floating barge was extremely difficult to tow.  The vessels were caught in a clockwise back-eddy off of the southwesterly flowing Alaska stream which carried them towards the northeast.The weather remained severe (Beaufort Force 9 with icy conditions) throughout the entire incident.  Even though the tug Marine Explorer remained attached to the barge, it was virtually impossible for it to influence their naturally drifting motion and trajectory.  On January 11, 1989, the owners requested USCG assistance in sinking the barge.  On January 13, the USCG Cutter Sedge  used 1500 rounds of 20 mm fire to sink Barge 283 in approximately 102 fathoms of water.  The case was closed on January 18, 1989.  USCG district 17.

The materials that were reported by Mr. Winkler varied, but he stated that they were affecting his health and the health of his neighbors.  NOAA advised that potential health and/or environmental impacts should be reported to local and state health officials and to state environmental officials.  Mr. Winkler reported that he had made a number of these reports to State and County officials but was not satisfied with their response.  After the first call, NOAA looked at the thermal images of the Gulf Stream and discussed with Mr. Winkler that Gulf Steam waters or material dumped in New York City would not be in direct contact with Bethany Bay beaches.  NOAA also contacted marine laboratories and phytoplankton experts at the University of Delaware, NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Laboratories at Mountlake, WA, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, and the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.  The names and contact numbers for phytoplankton experts at these institutions were provided to Mr. Winkler.   NOAA coordinated with the State of Delaware's environmental officials on each of the ""red tide"" reports that we received and with our efforts in contacting expert laboratories to determine the results of Mr. Winkler's samples.  On September 15th the Delaware's Director of Water Resources wrote a 4-page letter to Mr. Winkler listing the considerable efforts of the State of Delaware's Department of Water Resources to investigate each of Mr. Winkler's reports.  Delaware's letter noted that samples analyzed by DNREC ""reveal no Pfieseria, no significant water chemistry findings, and no presence of organisms in bloom-like conditions"" and that the ""water samples collected by you (Mr. Winkler) and DNREC that have been analyzed by the Florida Marine Research Institute and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute have revealed no harmful species, no toxic dinoflagellate species, and no red tide cell concentrations."" On September 22ed the NOAA SSC discussed Mr. Winkler's reports with the Chief of the Bethany Beach Fire Company and a member of the Bethany Beach Town Council.  Both the Fire Chief and the member of the Town Council reported that there were no unusual health impact reports from swimmers using the city's beaches.    On September 29th the laboratories at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington reported to DNREC that they were able to detect numbers of plankton specie named ""Chattonella verruculosa"" in the samples of water that were provided to them by Mr. Winkler.   This plankton had previously been reported in waters as far north as North Carolina, but experts at the University of North Carolina reported that it was unusual for this species to be as far north as Delaware.  This plankton did produce a brevetoxin  On October 12th the State of Delaware organized a seminar to discuss the complexity of the algal booms and their potential toxicity in Mid Atlantic Ocean waters.  As a result of Delaware's efforts, scientists from Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina are sharing information on the algal booms reported off their coasts.  It seems clear to these scientists that much of the ""reds stuff in the water"" sightings reported during the summer of 2000 were algal booms.  The scientists reported that it is not unusual for these blooms to drift with the currents and appear or disappear from one day to the next (or even hour to hour.)  The ""disappearing"" of the bloom is likely due to wind and other weather conditions.  For example, when it is windy, the bloom, that is often concentrated near the surface, can be mixed down several feet and thus become almost invisible.  If the wind subsides and the sun conditions are right, these organisms can float or swim back to the surface and again become much more visible.  USCG district 7."

The most likely scenario would be a small, continuous leak from the tank's vent pipes.  However, a catastrophic release of the entire fuel tank could occur any time during or after the sinking of the vessel.  Since the vessel was subject to the Tongass Narrows currents,  the visible extent of the slick and sheen could range from a few meters in length to a few thousand meters, respectively.      NOAA suggested that the Coast Guard check the water depth at the pier because a partial sinking could result in a tidally induced pumping action which would cause a much greater rate of outflow of diesel fuel.

The discharge was continuous throughout this visit as well.  Nonimpacted shoreline above the discharge and bottom samples from the nearshore area further delineated the extent of contamination.   Calculations of the impact suggest a volume of between 100 and 1,000 gallons of residual petroleum along the shoreline.  This volume of petroleum would likely dissipate in a matter of weeks once the release was discontinued.  The surrounding area along the Detroit River was also considered in making the recommendation.  NOAA recommended that, once discharge was controlled, the shoreline should be evaluated to ensure that residual petroleum does not persist beyond the expected period.  USCG district 9."

Apparently, a blowout preventer (BOP) valve malfunction caused the initial blowout.  Although the BOP had successfully shut the annulus between the drill pipe and well casing, the blind rams failed to shear through the drill pipe that was still in the well casing.  Therefore, oil and gas flowed out of the well, up the drill pipe, and onto the platform where it ignited.  The oil discharge increased after the escaping gas and oil forced the drill pipe out of the well.  The initial fire was extinguished by October 17.  As of October 28, the well was still spewing out a yellow gas/crude mix  60-100 feet in the air.

Subsequent investigation showed the sheen to be originating from the creek bank approximately 1500 yards upstream adjacent to property owned by Plabell Rubber Products, Inc.  The creek bank was found to be saturated with oil which was leaching into the creek.  Fifty feet directly up the creek bank on Plabell property were fill pipes for two 1000 gallon underground storage tanks used by the company.  The tanks contained a ""chemically neutralized heavy napthenic distillate,"" product name CIRCO LIGHT RPO (Sun Refining and Marketing).Oil samples were taken from the tanks, water, and soil, and sent to the City of Toledo Environmental Services Agency and the Coast Guard Central Oil Identification Laboratory (COIL) in Groton, Connecticut, for analysis.  The Coast Guard MSO, Toledo, also deployed a sorbent boom to contain the oil.Results of the COIL lab testing indicated that samples from the tanks and water were very similar, but contained differences that could not be attributed to weathering or contamination alone.  The president of Plabell Rubber declined responsibility based on these differences between the tank and pollutant samples.On November 17, another large rainbow sheen was found on the Maumee emanating from Swan Creek.

The subsequent release of DDB into the marine environment was calculated by Chugach to be 5-10 gallons per day.  As a result, on June 2, 1986, Chugach voluntarily de-energized and depressurized its cable, reducing fluid loss to 1-2 gallons per day and commenced an inspection program.

The barge was loaded with 20,000 barrels of Number 6 Fuel Oil.  Fifteen minutes later, the E-24 was standing almost vertically with about 20 feet of the barge visible above the surface of the water.  At the time of the incident, there was heavy rain, 5-6 foot seas, and winds from the east at 25 knots.  The incident took place in an area known as ""The Race"", the passage between the Long Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean, which typically has severe rip tides and rough, unpredictable seas.  On November 23 at 2250 the barge sank in a keel-up position in 185 feet of water.  Approximately 15-24 barrels of Number 6 fuel oil was forced from compartment vents, and as much as 47 barrels of diesel fuel was lost from the pump room. The cargo compartments were not damaged during the sinking.Oil from the barge formed a slick measuring 0.5 miles long by 500 yards wide as observed on November 23.

Later releases of oil occurred during the salvage operations, but skimming equipment was on station and recovered most of that lost oil immediately.  An estimated 225 birds were affected by the spill, with 75 of these recovered dead.Salvage of the barge without damaging the intact cargo compartments was the major concern.  Due to heavy seas and limitations of equipment on scene, the exact position of the barge could not be determined and verified until December 19.  On January 3, 1986, the USCG On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) federalized the case as the responsible party, Eklof Transportation Co., Inc. was unable to meet the deadlines imposed by the OSC for performing the hull survey and inspection.Evaluation, planning, and mobilization for the salvage operations took place from January 3 to May 4, 1986.  The salvage plan was developed by the United States Navy Supervisor of Salvage (NAVSUPSALV) at the request of the OSC.  The OSC staff report was completed on March 3, and detailed three salvage options determined by the NAVSUPSALV.  After much deliberation, the OSC determined that the barge should be raised with its cargo intact.  Salvage operations took place from May 5 to May 30, 1986.  Approximately 235 gallons of oil were lost during the entire operation, of which 185 were recovered.

The Patmos was carrying 828,300 barrels of Kirkuk crude oil while the Castillo de Montearagon was in ballast.  The Patmos caught fire and was grounded on the beach of Villagio Torre Faro, Sicily.  Firefighters subsequently towed the vessel off the beach to maneuver it for firefighting efforts.  The fire was extinguished on March 23, and the Patmos was brought to dock at Messina, Sicily. Approximately 5,300 barrels of Kirkuk crude oil spilled from the Patmos.  The majority of the spilled oil moved south through the Straits of Messina.  Most of the oil broke up in the variable currents of the strait, forming separate slicks that moved south at different rates.  Some of the oil initially released moved to the north due to tidal currents.  By March 23, most of the oil to the north had dissipated, but there was some sheen and mousse in the area.  As the oil moved south it incorporated garbage,  amounts of which typically exist in the waters east of Sicily.  A slick of about 750 barrels remained off the coast near Taormina in spite of onshore winds, for two days.  Small amounts of oil impacted the shore near Agnone Bagni, Capo Campolato, and Pozzillo.  The rest of the oil moved to the southeast away from Sicily and dissipated in the sea.

Funds for the spill cleanup initially came from the USCG revolving oil pollution fund.  An overflight of the area was conducted at 1400.   The spill occurred during a time when thousands of migratory birds are overwintering in the area.  Between 1,500 and 2,000 of these birds were oiled as a result of the spill.  Many birds were treated at the South Whidbey Island Wildlife Clinic.  On December 23, personnel at a bird clinic established at Mukilteo's Olympic Junior High school began cleaning and feeding hundreds of oiled birds.  The birds were washed with dish washing detergent and tube-fed a mixture of Kaopectate, honey, high-protein baby cereal, activated charcoal, thirst-quencher, and poison antidote until the center received a high-protein feed donated by Ralston Purina's Woodinville, Washington plant.  Due to this donation and excellent handling, 60 percent of the 428 cleaned birds were last reported as surviving, as compared to an average survival rate of 20 percent for oiled birds.Manual cleanup of beaches was most prevalent where waters were too shallow for cleanup vessels.

The pilot and one crewman were recovered with serious burns.  One crewman remained missing and was presumed dead after an extensive search.  The explosion caused a relatively minor release of oil.  Flames from the initial and subsequent explosions shot as high as 1000 feet into the sky.  The fires on board the vessel were extinguished by late afternoon on November 1.Following the explosion, the USCG On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) ordered the vessel towed out of the vicinity of San Francisco Bay.  The intent of the order was to minimize the potential for catastrophic environmental effect from a massive release of oil.  On the basis of trajectory forecasts, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) recommended that the vessel be towed to the vicinity of a nearby ocean dumping site (37 32 N, 122 59 W).

The vessel suffered a structural failure which ruptured the hull near the No. 2 tanks.  The resulting spill of approximately 65,500 barrels of Venezuelan Merey and Pilon crude oil was carried in a westerly direction by wind and currents.  Offshore recovery was hampered by rough weather and the magnitude of the spill.

Oil impacts were severe at Rollover Inlet and Crystal Beach, and on Aug. 4 more oil was pushed ashore further south along the Galveston Island coast.  The spill affected 90% of Galveston's West Beach, including 80% of the Galveston seawall and the associated rock groins and pilings.  Oil in the seawall area was a concern due to the oils smothering effect on marine organisms.  Organisms in this area were determined to be a minor part of the entire ecosystem and due to their transient nature were able to move to more suitable habitats.  Several dead crabs, rays, and fish were recovered along the seawall but could not be directly attributed to the spill.  Also oiled were marsh grass areas in East Bay (10-20 barrels) and 2 small lagoons.

Weather at the time was cloudy and overcast with light rain.  Visibility was 8 miles with winds gusting from the northwest to 25 miles per hour.  Crew error was the primary cause of the accident.  The barges, V882, V883, V884, and V885, were laden with a total of approximately 65,003 barrels of Montana Mix sour crude oil.  One of the barges exploded on impact and burst into flames.  As the fire continued to spread, the tow broke, setting three of the burning barges adrift down the river.  The tug and attached barge V885 were moved to the Peabody Coal facility at mile 179.2 for lightering and inspection.The three drifting barges caused extensive damage to facilities and other barges along the left descending bank on the Illinois side of the river.  While traveling downriver, one of the barges struck the Pillsbury Grain dock facility.  The fire spread to the dock, the grain elevator, and trees and bushes on the shoreline.  Three grain barges nearby caught fire as well.  A coal barge on the Missouri side of the river ignited from contact with one of the barges.  The Monsanto dock caught fire after being struck by one of the barges, and the impact ruptured a pipeline on a walkway, releasing approximately 100 pounds of monochlorobenzene into the river.Barge V884 suffered the most damage, both the barge and its discharged cargo on the river's surface were in flames.  After drifting downstream, V884 sank at mile 178.2 Upper Mississippi River (UMR) near the Cahokia Power Plant.  The barge continued to release its total cargo of 10,882 barrels of crude oil.  While burning out of control, barge V883 lodged bow first into the bank above the Cahokia Power Plant.  The fire spread uncontrollably onto the shore.  An hour later, V883 broke loose and continued drifting down the river, still engulfed in flames.  The M/V Katie  eventually grounded V883 by pushing it into the bank at the Pillsbury Facility.  The leading barge, V882, was forced into the Arsenal Island barge fleet area after being controlled by the M/V Gary D. Partridge.  The USCG Cutters Obion  and Cheyenne  fought the fire on V883 as well as the fire at the Phillips facility.  The cutters used all but two of their fire fighting foam cans.  To reduce the probability of reflash, the Cheyenne  applied a low-velocity water fog to V883.  The M/V Tom McConnel  used her propwash to keep burning oil on the water from reaching the Cheyenne  during firefighting operations.  By 1330 on April 3, the fires on the three escaped barges, the three grain barges, and the Pillsbury dock were out.  Valley Towing Service, Inc., the owners of the tug and barges, assumed financial responsibility for the cleanup.

On February 10, 1983, a tanker collided with a platform.  The platform developed a 45-degree tilt and had to be shut down.  Wave action and corrosion apparently caused the riser to collapse into the wellhead causing a spill of approximately 1,500 barrels per day.  The well was not capped because the field was in the middle of the Iran/Iraq war zone. This platform was attacked by Iraqi planes in March and the resulting slick caught fire.  This well was capped by the Iranians on September 18, 1983.  Eleven people were killed during the operation.In March 1983, a nearby platform was attacked with rockets by Iraqi helicopters.  The platform burned and spilled oil at an initial rate of approximately 5,000 barrels per day.  The rate slowed to about 1,500 barrels per day in the two years before the well was capped.  In May 1985, the fire was extinguished and the well was plugged with the assistance of divers.  Nine men died during these operations.  Approximately 733,000 barrels of oil spilled into the sea as a result of this incident.  It is estimated that the rate of oil leaking into the Persian Gulf in mid-May of 1983 was between 4,000 and 10,000 barrels per day due to more war-related activity or the collapse of burning platforms.  As a result of this incident, a cooperative program for large-scale trajectory modeling was developed between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Kuwait's Environment Protection Council under the Ministry of Public Health.

After the Olympic Glory moored at Barbours Cut, an inspection diver confirmed the presence of a 6 by 12 foot hole in the vessel's No. 6 port wing tank.  Approximately 20,000 barrels of Galeota crude were lost before the damaged tank could be lightered by portable pumps.First day response efforts focused on containment of the spilled product.  Crowley Environmental was contracted by the owners of the Olympic Glory to lead the cleanup effort.  Crowley subcontracted four other cleanup companies to aid in the operation.  Cleanup operations were divided into three separated zones.   Zone 1 covered the areas between Morgan's Point  and the Houston Yacht Club Marina.

The master and seven crew members died as a result of the accident.  Approximately 98,955 barrels of oil spilled into the sea as a result of the breakup.  The bow section, which still contained 36,650 barrels of oil, sank in 300 feet of water.  Substantial amounts of oil continued to leak from the sunken bow until several small leaks in the bow were sealed in May.  The stern remained afloat and was towed to the port of Le Havre where its remaining 54,975 barrels of oil were offloaded.Strong northwest winds at the time of the incident moved the oil towards the Breton coast.  Due to the high viscosity of the oil and severe weather conditions, containment or dispersal at sea was impossible.  Because the spring tides in this region have an average tidal range of 26 feet, many areas along the coast could not be boomed effectively.  Consequently, the Breton coast (which had already received major oil impacts from the Torrey Canyon  spill in 1967 and the Amoco Cadiz  in 1978), was again severely oiled.  Approximately 45 percent of the Amoco Cadiz  spill area was affected by oil from the Tanio.  Approximately 125 miles of the coastline of the two Departments of Finistere and Cotes-du-Nord were oiled.Both Departments implemented the Plan Polmar, the French national oil spill contingency plan, due to the severity of the coastal oiling.  This enabled them to use the national army for cleanup operations.  Personnel from the Civil Defense organization, fire service, local governments, commercial contractors, and local farmers were also involved in the cleanup.  The International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation (ITOPF) provided technical advice and monitored cleanup activities on behalf of the International Oil Pollution Compensation (IOPC) Fund.  Cleanup operations in the two Departments varied due to differences in the severity of the pollution, nature of the shoreline, and the cleanup policies that were implemented.

The cargo of catalytic cracker feedstock and Santa Maria crude oil spilled into the sea as the fire burned for ten hours.   Lightning apparently ignited accumulated cargo vapors on the deck of the vessel.  None of the cargo tanks had been gas-freed.  The explosion was so powerful that a 5 foot by 7 foot hull fragment from the burning vessel penetrated the roof of a Shell Oil Company petroleum product shore tank located 600 feet inland from the vessel.  The contents of that shore tank, approximately 26,000 barrels of ethyl alcohol, ignited and burned as well.  As the fire spread into a nearby barge slip, four barges that were discharging cargo caught fire.  Three of these barges exploded and sank.  No significant amount of pollution came from any of these four barges.  Weather during the incident was warm and windy with heavy downpours and lightning.  The maximum reported wind gust for the day was 33 knots, at 1300.The fireboat M/V Captain F. L. Farnsworth, which had been moored 2.5 nautical miles from the terminal, was on-scene by 1430.  Four boats and 14 Coast Guard personnel assisted in fire fighting and lifesaving operations.  Two Coast Guard pollution team investigators from the Houston Port Safety Station were already on their way to the Shell terminal when the accident occurred.  They led the rescue of the burning vessel's boatswain from the forecastle.  Representatives from both the USCG Pacific and Gulf Strike Teams (PST and AST) monitored all phases of the cleanup.  Eighteen different cleanup companies were involved in the cleanup operations.  Since the spill occurred over a holiday weekend, it was difficult to recruit companies with equipment specifically needed for this spill.  One crew member and two radar repairmen aboard the SS Chevron Hawaii  were killed and 13 people were injured.

The water depth at the wellhead site is about 50 m (164 feet). The IXTOC I was being drilled by the SEDCO 135, a semi-submersible platform on lease to Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX). A loss of drilling mud circulation caused the blowout to occur. The oil and gas blowing out of the well ignited, causing the platform to catch fire. The burning platform collapsed into the wellhead area hindering any immediate attempts to control the blowout. PEMEX hired blowout control experts and other spill control experts including Red Adair, Martech International of Houston, and the Mexican diving company, Daivaz. The Martech response included 50 personnel on site, the remotely operated vehicle TREC, and the submersible Pioneer I. The TREC attempted to find a safe approach to the Blowout Preventer (BOP). The approach was complicated by poor visibility and debris on the seafloor including derrick wreckage and 3000 meters of drilling pipe. Divers were eventually able to reach and activate the BOP, but the pressure of the oil and gas caused the valves to begin rupturing. The BOP was reopened to prevent destroying it. Two relief wells were drilled to relieve pressure from the well to allow response personnel to cap it. Norwegian experts were contracted to bring in skimming equipment and containment booms, and to begin cleanup of the spilled oil.

The damage was attributed to a fracture initiated by a weld defect and aggravated by wave impacts on the bow at low temperatures.  Although the tanker remained intact for some time after the initial hull plate failure, the bow and stern sections eventually separated and spilled an estimated 43,900 barrels of Bunker C into Cabot Strait.  The bow and stern sections drifted towards Canadian waters.  Approximately 50,000 barrels of oil remained in the bow section while 115,000 barrels remained in the stern.A wide band of mobile pack ice initially prevented the spilled oil from reaching the shoreline.  The Environmental Protection Service (EPS) immediately initiated the formation of the Regional Environmental Emergencies Team (REET) to provide assistance and advice to the Canadian Coast Guard's (CCG) On-Scene Commander (OSC).  REET members included the Atmospheric Environment Service, Bedford Institute of Oceanography, and Fisheries Management Service.  The REET was divided into three sections to deal with the three distinct problems: the bow, the stern, and the oil spill cleanup.  Under Lloyds Open Forum, the stern section was towed to Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia, to recover remaining oil.  The bow section was towed to a deep water area 200 nautical miles off Nova Scotia and sunk by gunfire from the HMCS Margaree  on April 1, 1979.

This platform is 180 miles southwest of the Ekofisk oil field center in approximately 230 feet of water.  The blowout resulted in the first major oil release in the North Sea.  A red-brown mixture composed of oil and mud spurted up to 180 feet into the air above the offshore drilling rig.  The ""blowout preventer"" had apparently been placed upside down on the wellhead during an earlier maintenance procedure.  The 112 crew members on the platform were safely evacuated.  The blowout resulted in a continuous discharge of crude oil through an open pipe 20 meters above the sea surface.  At an estimated rate of 1170 barrels per hour, approximately 202,380 barrels of oil escaped before the well was finally capped 7 days later on April 30th.  Considerably less oil entered the water due to rapid evaporation.  As much as 30-40% of the escaping oil may have evaporated before of shortly after hitting the water.  A higher than average air temperature (75?F) and the formation of small oil droplets contributed to rapid evaporation rate.Four to six foot sea conditions and below average sea surface temperature conditions existed in the area of the platform at the time of the blowout.Red Adair was contracted by Phillips to assist in capping the blowout.  Although weather conditions and hazardous gas accumulations slowed capping efforts, the rig was capped on April 30.

The bow, protruding at a 30? angle, was approximately 30 to 40 feet out of the water while the stern rested on the bottom in approximately 105 feet of water.  The STC-101, loaded with 19,531 barrels of No. 6 Fuel Oil, was en-route from the AMOCO Refinery in Yorktown, Virginia, to the AMOCO Terminal in Baltimore at the time of the incident.Initially, only a small rainbow sheen, believed to be from deck machinery diesel and lube oil, was observed around the barge.  Clean Water Inc. was contracted by  Steuart Transportation, the barge owner, to stage pollution abatement equipment near the scene in the event of a spill during salvage operations.  An underwater survey of the barge on February 4 reported no oil leaking from the barge, however, oil patches and light sheen were reported in the surrounding area on February 5.  After the STC-101  was refloated on February 6 by the McLean Construction Company, the barge was intentionally grounded in Ingram Bay for dewatering operations.  Extensive damage to the port side was discovered.  Severe wind and weather conditions as well as poorly maintained and improperly secured cargo hatches may have contributed to the oil spillage.After the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Office Hampton Roads received several reports of oil and birds washing up on surrounding shorelines, a Federal spill was declared on February 8.  On February 19, the AMOCO Terminal in Baltimore, Maryland, concluded that 5,959 barrels of oil were missing from the STC-101  barge.Beach and marsh areas of both the eastern and western shores of Chesapeake Bay were contaminated.  Large areas of dormant oiled marsh grasses were cut, leaving the root systems intact.  Virginia authorities estimated that between 20,000 and 50,000 waterfowl were killed as a result of the spill.The bulk of the cleanup was completed by mid-March.  A final inspection on November 5 revealed little evidence of oil remaining in the affected areas.  USCG district 5.

At 0045, the radar revealed an object approximately 9 miles away on the starboard side of the vessel.  The Captain of the vessel claimed that he saw no navigational lights on the platform even though a Chevron spokesman said they were functioning properly.  The mate failed to plot the object.  At 0130, the port bow of the vessel struck the eastern side of the platform, opening up a gash 2 feet wide by the length of the bow tank.  The cargo ignited and the fire spread towards 15 drums of lube oil.  An emergency call was made and the ship was abandoned while fire and smoke engulfed the forward port section of the ship.Personnel working on other platforms in the area immediately responded to the accident.

On February 2, the National Pollution Contingency Plan, instituted by President Johnson in 1968, went into effect for the first time.  The Federal Water Pollution Control Administration was on-scene to monitor the well-killing process and cleanup.  Red Adair was brought in to provide expertise capping the well.  To aid in predicting the slick movement, the National Weather Service set up a local station to monitor winds and tides.

At the time of the incident the weather consisted of southwesterly gale force winds, overcast skies, heavy swells, and poor visibility.  Only ten of the 34 crew members survived the accident.  The stern section of the vessel sank after about two hours, while the bow section drifted southwest with the Agulhas Current.  The bow was presumed to sink at 30 06 S, 031 54 E, approximately 40 miles from the initial breakup.  All the ship's cargo, 334,043 barrels of Kuwait crude oil, eventually spilled into the Indian Ocean.  The response was led by the Port Captain of Durban.  Since the economy of Natal, South Africa, depended on the upcoming winter tourist season, the primary response goal was to keep the oil from impacting the mainly recreational shoreline.  Dispersant operations were organized by personnel from the Department of Fisheries and the Department of Industries.  Other parties involved in the response include the Department of Transportation, South African Defense Force, the Durban Corporation, the Oceanographic Research Institute, the Natal Anti-Shark Measures Board, and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.  Wildlife impacts were minimal.  Duration of response was approximately 20 days with an estimated cost of $420,000.  Keyword: Adverse weather conditions, sinking.."

The vessel was loaded with approximately 119,000 barrels of Venezuelan crude oil.  The hull was severely damaged during the grounding causing the vessel to spill approximately 37,000 barrels of oil into the Atlantic Ocean at a location one and one-half miles offshore.Approximately 72,500 barrels of oil were pumped from the vessel into another tanker, the Esso Margarita.  Steam lines were rigged to heat the cargo to facilitate pumping.  Moving the salvage vessels into position and offloading the remaining cargo was performed during extremely severe weather.  Dive surveys reported that the keel was crushed and buckled and that there was extensive damage to the hull of the vessel.  Salvage and response personnel decided that the only feasible action was to sink the General Colocotronis.  Following the offloading operations, the cargo tanks were flushed with dispersants to remove the residual oil.  The vessel was then towed out to deep water and sunk.  USCG district 7.

The vessel broke in two several hours after the grounding, spilling Venezuelan light crude oil into the harbor.  The aft section of the vessel drifted farther into the harbor and grounded, while the forward section was anchored in place.  Three days later, U. S. Navy tugs tried to tow the forward section out of the harbor.  Adverse weather hindered the operation, and eventually drove the forward section farther into the harbor.  On March 10, the forward section broke open in heavy seas and released more oil into the water.  By the first week of April, both parts of the tanker were lightered and towed out to sea where they were sunk.  USCG district 7.  Keyword: Sorbents, manual removal, emsulfier, sinking.."

The entire cargo, approximately 860,000 barrels (references range between 857,600 and 872,300 barrels), was released into the sea or burned during the next twelve days.  Ships of the Royal Navy carrying detergents were en route to the scene within four hours of the grounding.The response command post was established at Plymouth.  The Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy implemented an early warning system for oil movement.  A panel of expert scientists was assembled to consider scientific problems involved with the cleanup procedure.  Local authorities were instrumental in dealing with the oil beached within their jurisdictions.A detergent, primarily BP1002, was sprayed on much of the floating oil to emulsify and disperse it.  Manual methods were used for removal of oil on many of the sandy beaches, although the dissected nature of the shoreline made it impossible to clean the whole coastline.  The vessel lost structural integrity on March 26, releasing more oil into the water.   Since towing the vessel off of the reef was deemed impossible, the government decided to bomb the vessel.

The vessel was old and the oceanic crossing was scheduled to be her final journey.  After delivery of her cargo, the ship was destined for destruction as scrap.  Shortly following departure, a welded seam ruptured between two steel plates on the starboard side, well above the water line.  The U.S. harbor authorities refused permission to return to Los Angeles.  The vessel then proceeded to Ensenada Harbor in Baja California to have the ruptured seam repaired by welding.  Authorities in Ensenada refused permission to have the repair work done within the Harbor so welders were taken aboard and the ship proceeded offshore an estimated 60 miles to have the welding accomplished.  At this distance offshore, the vessel may have been situated within the influence of the southward-flowing California Current System. Welding repairs were completed successfully.  Unfortunately, a dense fog settled throughout the region.  A single sun sight was made within the two days offshore, to establish the ship's position.  On this basis, a return to Ensenada was undertaken to offload the welders.  In the early morning hours of March 29 1957, the vessel struck the coast at a location about 64 km south of Ensenada Harbor.  The bow grounded against one side of the entrance to a small cove on a predominantly rocky shore.  The stern apparently swung around and stuck on a shallow spot midway across the cove (henceforth Tampico cove) entrance.  The hull thus served as a breakwater across about 2/3 of the cove entrance, creating fairly calm conditions landward of the hull.  The crew and passengers were able to disembark and reach shore safely in the lee of the hull.  A portion of the oil cargo was liberated at the time of grounding.  The remainder escaped over the next 6-9 months as the ship was slowly torn asunder by pounding surf.   The location was in a remote section of coastline so no countermeasures were taken to remove a portion of the cargo or lessen ensuing pollution of the shore.  A few shacks scattered along the coast here housed native fishermen and their families.  The site was accessible by an extremely rough road, best negotiated by 4-wheel drive vehicles.  The main paved highway ran about 10-20 miles inland and the trip from there  to the study site required 2-3 hours.  Keyword: accidental grounding, diesel oil, mixing by surf."
